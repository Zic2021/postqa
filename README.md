# postqa
postqa is a note app made for anyone who wants to store their questions and answers on the web browser.
I have built this website for me, because I found it difficult to store my coding snippets on google doc or notepad.
That is why I made this site to help me store my questions and answers.

Right now you can store your content on localhost(web browser) making it impossible to access from any devices.
I would like for user to access it from anywhere but currently counting every pennies I have. In the future you will be able to access your 
content by login in.
